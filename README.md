What I Learned 💻🎮

I discovered a ton of shortcuts to make coding faster! ⚡

Quick Formatting: I learned to format whole sections of code in a flash. 🪄
Commenting Ease: I can now quickly comment out sections of code to explain or disable them. 📝
Alignment Magic: Using Shift + Tab, I can easily align code elements to the left or right. 📐
While I love coding, I realized I'm not cut out for design. 🎨 Creating truly beautiful designs with code is hard work. 😓 I'm much happier focusing on the front-end where I can bring ideas to life. 🌐

Code Challenges 🐛

JavaScript Placement: I had trouble getting JavaScript to work correctly when it was inside the HTML file. 😕
Z-Index Mystery: I couldn't figure out how to properly layer elements using z-index to get the GIFs to appear above the popup. 😵‍💫
Header Headache: Designing the 90s-style header was a real challenge. There were no easy shortcuts, and I had to do it manually. 🤯
Sound Icon Snafu: I couldn't get the sound icon to control audio because there was no audio on the page. 🔇
Cursor Curiosity: I added a fun cursor: progress effect to mimic old computer loading times. ⌛
Popup Positioning: The popup sometimes appears in the wrong position, especially for longer content. 📐
Music Popup Placeholder: I added an "under construction" message to the music popup. 🚧
Private Office Popup: I decided not to include popups for the Private Office page. 🚫
Late Nights and Early Mornings 🌙

After a 24-hour marathon with a 2-hour nap and another 16+ hour sprint, I have a newfound respect for designers. 🙇‍♂️ Creating beautiful designs is hard work. 🎨

I'm so happy I was able to bring my 90s vision to life!  nostalgic_face I can't wait to continue learning and creating with CodedEx! 🚀
